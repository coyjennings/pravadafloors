This limited warranty does not cover negligence, improper installation or maintenance, damages resulting from improper care, insufficient protection, improper alterations or repairs to the original materials, insects, severe accidents, exposure to extreme heat, moisture or dryness, inadequate product choice for conditions, burns, fire, natural disasters, or “Acts of God.”
The surface wear must be readily visible and cover at least 15% of the total area of flooring product for a claim to be considered.
The surface wear or damage is not the result of abuse, improper care and maintenance, sliding furniture or heavy objects across the floor without proper protection, severe impact, scratching, curling, or chemical damage. Variation or reduction in gloss in not considered wear.
This limited warranty applies to water damage from normal household spills when removed promptly. This limited warranty specifically excludes water damage from standing water, urine, or other corrosive liquids, excessive subsurface penetration or moisture emissions from concrete, leaking pipes or faucets, leading appliances such as but not limited to washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators, hydrostatic pressure, flooding, natural disasters, or Acts of God.
This limited warranty does not cover mouldings, underlay or accessories that are used with this product or any damage resulting from the use of these products with flooring.
Laminate flooring panels installed with any manufacturing defect are not covered by this limited warranty. Any known manufacturing defect must be reported prior to product installation, or under any circumstance, no longer than thirty (30) days after the date of purchase to be covered under this limited warranty. Any such defective material will be replaced at no additional cost to the customer. Any damage that occurs during shipping is the responsibility of the shipping company.
This limited warranty does not cover difference in sheen that may occur from board to board with medium to dark colours of the product.
Humidity should be between 35-55% and maintained throughout the year. Maintaining humidity levels may require use of a humidifier/dehumidifier.
Pravada laminate floors may be installed over hydronic radiant heat  subflooring. To prevent buckling, warping, and cupping, never change the temperature of radiant heated subfloors by more than 1°C (2°F) each day. Before installing Pravada laminate, radiant heat systems must have been tested and operational for at least three weeks. Surface temperature of the subfloors must not exceed 27°C (82°F). Abruptly turning on or off the radiant heat system can cause crowning and cupping of the boards which will not be covered by warranty. It is recommended that radiant heat systems be turned on and off gradually.
Changing temperatures can affect the moisture content of wood products. As temperature rises, moisture decreases and may cause wood to shrink, and gaps will occur between boards. However, once the temperature decreases, moisture increases and the boards will close back up. This is known as seasonal gapping and will occur with or without a flooring heating system and in not covered by warranty. Using a humidifier/dehumidifier may decrease the effects of seasonal gapping.
Moisture of concrete subfloors or other subflooring must be tested prior to installing the floor. Tests must result in less than 2 lbs per 1000 square feet per calcium chloride moisture test. Written documentation of the moisture test must be obtained to validate this warranty.
A moisture barrier is required is required over concrete or gypsum floors and recommended for wood subfloor.
Some squeaking or noise from flooring can be expected with humidity and temperature fluctuations, uneven subfloors, tight floorboards or inadequate space or expansion gaps. To prevent squeaking, ensure humidity is maintained between 35-55%, closely monitor temperatures, allow adequate expansion gap space around the floors, and examine subfloors prior to installation. Floors installed over subfloor with variations exceeding +/- 2mm in 2m will void warranty. Consumer should level subfloor or use recommended glue for added strength in areas where floor is not level.
Discoloration caused by area rugs is not covered under warranty.
This limited warranty excludes dissatisfaction with colour, shade, texture variations from samples or printed colour representations of Pravada laminate products.</span></p><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-0b702bac"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-721f0b70">WARRANTY CLAIMS</span></p><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-b9c829de"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-d107b9c8">This limited warranty is not transferable, and extends only to the original end consumer.
